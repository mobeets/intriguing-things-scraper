Alexis Madrigal's [5 Intriguing Things](https://tinyletter.com/intriguingthings) is a usually-daily newsletter containing links to things. This repo maintains a (good enough) archive of those things, scraped from the emails stored on tinyletter.com. The data is updated [daily](https://morph.io/mobeets/intriguing-things-scraper) thanks to [Morph](https://morph.io).

You can browse the results [here](http://mobeets.github.io/intriguing-things/), or check out the repo for that page [here](https://github.com/mobeets/intriguing-things).
