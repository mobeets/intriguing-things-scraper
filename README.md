Alexis Madrigal's [5 Intriguing Things](https://tinyletter.com/intriguingthings) is a usually-daily newsletter containing links to things. The file `scraper.py` is run daily by [Morph](https://morph.io) to update a (good enough) archive of those things.

View the archive [here](https://morph.io/mobeets/intriguing-things-scraper), or better yet, browse the [results](http://mobeets.github.io/intriguing-things/).
